//! Who may capture, and where the frames go.
//!
//! The link side (`link`) and the audio tasks never touch each other: a
//! link task fills [`SPEAKER_FRAMES`] from the host's speaker frames and
//! drains its own [`MIC_FRAMES`] queue into its link (mic notifications of
//! the audio service over BLE, channel-7 reports over the cable); the
//! microphone task waits on [`MIC`]. Nothing here blocks or allocates, so a
//! link task can call it without awaiting.
//!
//! A host listens per link: the BLE host by subscribing to the mic
//! characteristic, the USB host with a LISTEN frame. A stream goes to one
//! link, chosen when it starts ([`audio_link`]: the cable first, as the deck
//! events go), and ends with `END_ERROR` if that link stops listening.
